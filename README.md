# Machine_Learning

In the field of Machine Learning, three main paradigms are commonly used: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. These paradigms differ in the type of data they use and their tasks. Supervised learning, which involves training models on labeled data to predict specific outcomes, is the most widely used. 
Unsupervised learning focuses on finding hidden patterns in unlabeled data, while reinforcement learning involves training models through feedback (rewards or penalties) in an interactive environment. In some cases, these paradigms can be combined, such as in semi-supervised learning or hybrid models, to improve performance or handle more complex tasks.
